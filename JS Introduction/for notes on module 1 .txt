---notes on 8. Dom Manipulation :
--document is object have attributes like document.body for <body></body> tag of html, document.head for head tag

--let div=document.getElementsByTagName("div");
--rhs of above return array of all div objects from html top to bottom to div object
--also we use let a=document.getElementById("idname");-->to select 1 element by idname to a object
--we can access then properties like a.innerText="xxx" like accessing JavaScript objects's properties
and change innerText of tag associated to object a
-- we will create a <canvas id="idname"></canvas> in html and give some style using css 
-- then get canvas tag to js object using DOM and manipulate it


---notes on 9. html5 canvas :

CB DATA STRUCTURES REAL LIFE 1. programming in JavaScript - 9.html5 canvas

Background image for canvas using css

Get canvas element in js and set canvas.height etc

To draw graphics on canvas one more object needed

Call getContext on canvas save to a variable pen

Pen.fillrect for drawing rectangle
Pen. Fillstyle to colour inside Rect

Pen.arc, fillstyle etc for circle and see Google for such canvas stuff
Note: explaination was a bit unclear but refer Google and grepper



-----------notes on 10. game loop:

CB DS REAL LIFE
1. Programming in js- 10. Game loop
***imp note :
Variables are declared globally without let,const,var in general very bad practice but here used 

Game loop:
1-Initialise objects
2- Draw<->Update infinite loop these 2 make until gave over

Create a rectangle object rect with 4 attributes (see Google)

Call pen.fillrect(rect.x...)(see Google and grepper)

Create 4 functions below(not sure whether it needs to be below or not) pen.fillerect namely:
Init, draw,update and gameloop and inside gameloop call draw them update

****Important note:
Canvas related code to go in init function along with pen,rect object declaration
And pen.fillstyle and pen.fillrect will go in draw

---Init called 1 but gameloop infinitely

Below all code call init and gameloop with setinterval method to call it indefinitely
NOTE: search google for setinterval and unknown functions

Now we use this gameloop getting called indefinitely to make changes on canvas
Like drawing rectangle on canvas for each iteration with changing its coordinates

Add speed property to rect in init function

Draw function should have pen.fillrect followed by pen.fillstyle
And update rect.x+=rect.speed

**"So basically draw function will create a rectangle and update will change the position of rect for next iteration"

But output of above code gives unwanted output hence we modify the code:

To solve this we call pen.clearRect as first line of draw for whole canvas 

**Also add code to make sure rectangle doesn't go out of canvas by adding if else in update function now:

-if rect's top right corner points 's x coordinate exceeds width of canvas or top left points x is less than 0(left most canvas coordinate) then make rect.speed*=-1

Box oscillate bw left and right boundaries at this point

***For game over:
Now inside init create global var gameover false initialised

Now so var f=setinterval...(below init call)
**Note: var f or f will have same scope but do f make it global to avoid confusion

Now inside gameloop function add if gameover is true clearinterval(f)

***Note: search google and grepper for functions
